# resistome-microbiome-analysis
This repository contains code and pipelines used to analyze resistome and microbiome data derived from shotgun metagenomic sequencing.
The analysis was conducted using the AMR++ pipeline and ResFinder (for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection).

AMR++ workflow includes:
- Preprocessing of raw metagenomic reads
- Taxonomic profiling of microbial communities
- AMR gene detection and quantification (with MEGARes databases)
- Normalization and transformation of abundance data
- Statistical analysis and visualization of resistome and microbiome profiles

This repository also contains R scripts and summary reports for downstream analysis.
